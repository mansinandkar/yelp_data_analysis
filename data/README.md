# Yelp Dataset

This project uses the **Yelp Open Dataset**, which includes business metadata, user profiles, and customer reviews.

The dataset is available in multiple JSON files and can be linked using identifiers like `business_id` and `user_id`.

**Important Notes:**
- Only structured Yelp dataset is used; photo data is excluded.
- Raw dataset is **not included** in this repository due to size and licensing restrictions.
- Download the dataset from the [official Yelp Open Dataset portal](https://www.yelp.com/dataset) and place the extracted files in this folder.

After downloading, the directory structure should look like:
